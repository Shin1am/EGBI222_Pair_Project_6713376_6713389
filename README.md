# EGBI222 Pair Project - Healthcare Stroke Dataset EDA

This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Healthcare Stroke Dataset using Python. It is designed as coursework for **EGBI222 Computer Programming** (Academic Year 2025), created by **Pannawat Thongpron (6713376)** and **Lapasrada Tiatrakul (6713389)**.

## Project Overview

The notebook contains mainly of this:
- Setting up the environment in Google Colab
- Loading and exploring the Healthcare Stroke Dataset
- Data cleaning and summary statistics
- Basic visualization using pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn

## Running the Code

You can run the notebook directly on Google Colab:

### Steps

1. **Download the Dataset**
   - Healthcare Stroke Dataset: [Kaggle Notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/nimapourmoradi/healthcare-stroke)
   - Save the dataset (CSV file) to your Google Drive

2. **Update the File Path**
   - In the notebook, set the correct path to your dataset:
     ```python
     file_paths = "your-path-to-dataset"
     df = pd.read_csv(file_paths)
     ```

3. **Run All Cells**
   - The notebook will guide you through mounting Google Drive, importing libraries, loading data, and performing EDA.
